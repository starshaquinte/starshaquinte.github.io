<h3>Academy Cinemas</h3>
<p>This web page is also an example of my html and css expertise, I created a website for movie goers to check out what's playing at their local theater. The video features me navigating to the location and history of the theater. There is also a Now Playing feature that has working links that will take you to a synopsis of the the movie of your choosing. The last section is an opportunity for the user to join th movie club by entering their email.</p>
